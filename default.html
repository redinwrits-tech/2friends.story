*# 2.friends.story: *(The Story)*

---

The story began with two friends:  
**Darios (Sarwat)** and **Redin (Zana)**.  
They both had one thing in common—  
a dream of one day becoming **Authors**.

---

With the help of:  
🎨 **Redin** – The Artist  
💡 **Darios** – Endless Ideas  

**TK Books** was created.

---

This is just the beginning...  
of a deeply enjoyed **Author-Journey**.
